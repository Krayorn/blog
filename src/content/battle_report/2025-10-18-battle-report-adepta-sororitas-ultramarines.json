    "description": "Our second game ever. We're getting confortable with the rules but we still have a lot to learn! Especially when reading the table. Once again, by reading the datasheets, both of us thought the Space Marines had all the tools to win and that the Sisters would have to settle for secondary objectives. It turned out to be completely wrong, but experience will help us understand that earlier and therefore make better choices in the future.",

We learned a lot from this game and the next one will surely be better on a tactical level. Hopefully, it won't be too long before we play again, and we should have a few more terrain pieces to replace the books!"
