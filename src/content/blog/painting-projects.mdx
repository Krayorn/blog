Last week, I wrote a post about my biggest on-going painting project, my [Warhammer Sisters Of Battle army](/posts/warhammer-army-project-symfony-of-suffering/).

This got me thinking about all the other armies, games, or more generally, miniatures that I want to tackle and motivated me a bit to revive a side project I spent two or three evenings working on to track my unpainted miniatures.

## Tracking the miniatures

To track all my unpainted miniatures, I've coded a simple website where I create a folder for each game, expansions, or box sets and then add the miniatures, noting if they're painted or not. 

I haven't logged my entire collection yet (which is alarming), but it's already giving me a good idea of where I'm at on a particular project.

So from what is currently logged, 15% of my miniatures are painted. It's bad. Really bad. But also kinda fun! I want to improve that percentage now!

I'll go into more details on this side project in another post but I count on hosting it and allowing people to add their own miniatures.

Let's now explore my different projects, they are basically divided into two categories: Warhammer and board games.

## Warhammer projects

Obviously, the biggest project is my Sisters Of Battle army. I still have a lot of models to paint, 2 tanks, 25 Seraphim (flying girls), 3 Paragons and 10 more infantry... And I'm also tempted to add an immolator, a castigator and the new combat patrol to it.

And as mentioned in the other post, I really like Drukhari as well, and I'm almost sure I'll be getting two combat patrol at least (4 boats, 20 Kabalites and 10 Incubi, all gorgeous models!) before they get their codex and change it.

But that's not all my warhammer models. 

I got gifted an Anvilgard box from Age Of Sigmar quite some time ago, almost everything is built, I even did the bases for the whole set, but did not start painting yet. I'd like to get those painted because I like the models, but I do not think I'd play with those, Cities of Sigmar is definitely not the Age Of Sigmar army I'd play first.

So the fact that I also got gifted a Daughters of Khaine big box is a nice coincidence! It's the old one with 5 snakes, and a blood cauldron which is so cool. It's half built, not painted. And this is an army I'd love to play. But is that suprising? It's basically a mix between Sisters and Drukhari. So I also want to paint those and maybe get a few more models (Morathi?).

Those are the main projects for my Warhammer miniatures. There are plenty of other things I like, but I won't start until I've made some serious progress on what's already there.

The stuff that could happen in the future are (not ordered):
- A Bretonnian army for the old world
- Slave to Darkness from Age Of Sigmar (I have quite a bit of already painted models from the old world warriors of chaos range so this could help.)
- I could see myself painting some Alpha Legion or old World Eaters (the white and blue color scheme) marines for either 40k or the Horus Heresy
- Rohirrims

Before transitioning to board games, I also want to mention two warhammer board games that I have. Cursed City and Space Hulk. 

They are not in the current project list, I like both of those games and play them from time to time, but maybe not enough to prioritize painting all their models. Some Cursed City models could be painted from time to time to be used in D&D or other roleplaying games though!

## Board games

All the projects I already mentionned are enough to keep me busy for a lifetime, but unfortunately for me I also have other games with minis I'd love to paint. (I'm pretty sure I could paint some of those really fast if I keep practicing tho!)

The first one of those is OrcQuest Warpath, I've already painted all the humans, enough to finish the first campaign. I'll paint the other factions as we progress through the expansions. There is a total of 172 miniatures to paint and I've completed 37 (gnhhh).

Another one of the "campaign" games with tons of miniatures I'd like to paint is Assassin's creed: Brotherhood of Venice. There are almost 200 miniatures and I've played some of the missions but with everything unpainted. The main issue is that just to start I'd have to paint around 50 miniatures right from the start, quite a project already. (For OrcQuest, I started with only 12, and added the others as we encountered them in the campaign).

That's the two biggest games where I'd like to play with painted stuff, but there are plenty of other boxes with fewer miniatures.

I want to paint the scenery and the squads from Star Wars: Shatterpoint (20 minis, but 4 buildings as well).

In Monster Hunter World, I painted 1 monster and 6 hunters already, and I'd like to paint 2 or 3 other big monsters.

I also have around 10 warriors from Senjutsu that would look dope painted.

Tales of the Rift is a cool game I don't play enough of, same for Godtear, one or two warband for each could go a long way in a short time!

I have way more games, but as long as they are not hitting the table often, I don't plan to paint them, which may be a vicious circle pushing them to not hit the table often enough but heh, can't paint everything. 

## Conclusion

All that to say: I'm in trouble. 

So many miniatures, so little time! However I'm hopeful, I'm currently painting a bit every week, progressing on some of those projects, and the more I paint, the faster I can go, which could really help speed up some of those projects (think zombies, skeletons, or ghouls)! 

The main thing is to make progress often. I'll probably keep writing posts about some of those when I hit a nice milestone!

In the meantime, thanks for reading and happy painting!
