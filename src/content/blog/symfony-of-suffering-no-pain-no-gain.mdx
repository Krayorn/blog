Six months later, I've come to share some progress on the army. Not as much as I hoped, but progress nonetheless! 

After our first 500pts game, I didn't really know what to start with, so I ended up picking the three Arco-flagellants. It's a small unit, perfect to keep me moving. I was not the biggest fan of them, I much prefer the Repentia models, but as I was not super confident in my scheme yet, they were a good first step to keep trying things.

They each got some yellow and black striped tubes to put some color on them, and the electric flails and other drugs were a good excuse to use the light blue accent color I'm also using on the Battle Sisters. After a conflicted start, the models grew on me. I'm still not gonna play an army full of flagellants, but I could see myself getting a squad of ten. You know, when the Order really needs to send forward some troops under heavy fire.

Once those were done, the next logical step was the bigger Penitent engine. It's an arco-flagellant as a base, in a huge machine. I have no idea how to paint my "tanks", the same gray color as my armor? Or the blue of the capes? I decided to try the blue/white on this one, with a lot of rust on the chassis, and to see how it went.

I'm somewhat happy with the result, I don't think it's really a good example of how it will look on a Rhino tho. I really like the burnt effect on the flamers, and I think the two braseros on his back are ok!

I then took a break, a way too long break. A few months without painting, and finally in August I painted plenty of things again... for other games. The second 1000 points game was approaching, and it was time to add a few more painted minis to the army, so I primed the Repentia and got to work!

I went to the local GW store and bought a few more paints to vary the skintones, and I'm really happy with the results.

Skin is not my strong suit, like with the capes, I'm not good at blending some transitions yet. But with their white swords, gray and blue shirts to match the army colors, I think they look nice!

And that's it for the painted progress for this update, that's 195 more points painted for my army, bringing me to 300 points of painted Sororitas. 

But that's not all I've done, I've also built 5 Seraphims, 5 Zephirims, 1 Jump pack Canoness, an Imagifier, and most of the Exorcist! 
With all those reinforcements, I was able to play my first two games at 1000 points with a buddy of mine (you can read the [battle reports](/battle_reports/2025-10-18-battle-report-adepta-sororitas-ultramarines/) here!).

## Some lore

Since the last update, I've had time to start thinking about some lore, and while writing up the last two battle reports, I've come up with names for a few of my sisters and squads to use when writing quotes (that's so fun btw, I have a blast coming up with stuff like "Weep not for the fallen").

Here are the squads and minis already named:

On the characters' side, we've got _Canoness Elira_, on the ground, she's the one holding the line.
Then we've got _Canoness Velatrix_, with her blessed halberd and a jump pack, she dives deep behind the enemy lines to take care of the troops on the enemy home objectives with the Zephirim.

Finally, only used in the first game, _Imagifier Sylana_, she did provide very good protection to my battle sisters.

Then we've got three named squads of flying gals:

- The first Seraphim squad: _Ventus Sanctus_ (Holy wind) led by the _Seraphim Superior Riennolis_, including _Sister Nyssala_. 
 - The second Seraphim squad: _Ira Volucris_ (Winged wrath) led by _Seraphim Superior Praxis_.
 - My Zephirims, _Obscura Vultus_ (Hidden faces), all with helmets, led by _Zephirim Superior Vayle_ and often accompanying _Canoness Velatrix_.


On the Penitent side, I've only got two named warriors, _Arco-flagellant Ezra #847_, and the Repentia Superior, _Sister Vyloris_.

And finally, the tanks gunners and pilots:
- For the Exorcist, _Sisters Santora and Ignatia_, respectively pilot and gunner.
- And for the Rhino, _Sisters Aspatea and Kathia_, in the same order.

I think I will end up with name for every single character, but I'm only naming them when I need quotes for battle reports so far! 

In the next update, I will try to create an Order Minoris for my army and define his style. I think that it will involve some secrecy or stealth elements and a penchant for speed and close combat.

## Next steps

I think I'm set on the next step, I'm gonna build 5 more Zephirims and paint those 20 flying girls!
Then, I'll have to decide between multiple good options:
- the 3 characters I have already built (that's 190 more points in just 3 minis, more than 200 with some enhancements!)
- Rhino && Exorcist
- Morven Vahl and her Paragon Warsuits (I want to magnetize those, and I'm a bit scared)

There's no excuse to buy more stuff yet because all three of those groups look like they'd be fun, but there is other units that I want to complete my collection:
- The new combat patrol: 10 Arco-flagellants, which are ok, but more importantly, 10 more Battle Sisters that I could build as Dominion, 1 Canoness with a different sculpt, and 5 Sacrosaints to go with the 5 I already have (not built yet).
- An Immolator and a Castigator because all the Sororitas tanks are gorgeous.
- Sainte Celestine, I don't think I need to explain why.

And further down the wishlist:
- A Hospitalier (to accompany the sacrosaints...) and a Palatine, they look sick!
- At least two, maybe three (3!) squads of Retributors to have one full melta and one full flamers
- A Novitiae squad

Listing all that, I realize that's going to take a looooong time to paint, one step at a time, first the flying girls, then we'll see.

See you for part three!
