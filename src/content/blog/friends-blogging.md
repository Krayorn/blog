Two years ago, I started this blog by writing the post [Why a blog](/posts/1-why-a-blog). I had spent about a year reading a lot of blogs online, most about software, some about productivity, and a few about writing. Since then, I've written quite a bit, and even more this year. 

I'm glad to have my own website, where I can create stupid pages like my cyberpunk theme project pages.

I found that some people online added links to a few of my posts ([HTTP server in Go](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/http-server-go/) and [Training a bigram and trigram language models](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/zero-to-hero-neural-networks-bigram-trigram-language-models/)) in their own blogs, and this makes me very happy. 

Recently, I wrote about having a [No bug policy](https://www.krayorn.com/posts/no_bug_policy/), and had quite a few interactions on Reddit. I'm pretty confident this is my most-read post. I'm very proud of putting my thoughts out there where they could be challenged.

I also reached out to three people who had published writing I liked and shared some of my own that felt relevant, and got some very nice replies, something I would not have done without starting my own blog.

Most importantly, I enjoy the process of writing and the output that results from it. 

For the last year or so, I've been buzzing some of my friends about starting their own. A few of them say they wanted to, or liked the idea, or that they might, but they didn't really start. 
I get it, I've been there. 
Every once in a while, they share something interesting with me, something they made or an idea, and I remind them that it would be dope if they shared it online, you know, to keep the topic on their minds. 

Well, it finally worked! Two of them made their own blog.

The first is [unicorns & dragons](https://blog.unicorns-and-dragons.com/) and the second one is [kaonashi.dev](https://kaonashi.dev/).

I like to think that I had a part in them finally hitting the deploy button. I'm still working on a few other friends, but I'm stoked about those two already and can't wait to see more of their things online. 

This made me think about webrings, and I think it would be fun to make one with our group. We have tons of hobbies in common, so there will be very relevant posts in all our blogs. But each of us also has our own interests, so there will be quite a wide range of content published.

I also just want to have links to my friends blogs on mine. They do great stuff, I want to help people find it.

If you're thinking about starting to write, please go for it (and send me a link)! You'll make the internet a more interesting place.
