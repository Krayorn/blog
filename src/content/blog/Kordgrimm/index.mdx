Need a new blade? You could visit Kordgrimm, he has just opened his shop in the port district.

You won't find better in Novigrad, this dwarf comes straight from Mahakam!

Yes, it's not common for a dwarf to settle in Novigrad, especially with the cult of eternal fire rampant, but he hardly had a choice, luck was never on his side.

His parents were killed in a pogrom in Aedirn when he was very young. He and his brother, Grimgar, were saved by a defender of Makaham: Brograr 'the Wall'. He is a living legend among the dwarves. During the pogrom, Brogar and three of his warriors made their way out of the city, saving around twenty non-humans in the process. Brogar is said to have held back and killed a dozen attackers while his men opened the city's heavy gates.

Once safe in Mahakam, the blacksmith Brukk took Kordgrimm on as an apprentice, while Grimgar joined Brogar's company. Korgrimm spent many long years assisting Brukk in his forge. Listening to the steel sing under the blows of the hammer, watching the flames sculpt the blades, feeling the calluses forge on his hands under the strain.

However, once trained, he had to open his own forge. Working as an assistant to another blacksmith was not the way to build your reputation - or your purse...

And that's why Kordgrimm found himself on the road, heading for Kaedwen. With Brogar's first medal, his brother's mace and a set of blacksmith's tools from his master, he set up shop in the small town of Acolet. But bad luck struck again. Shortly after his arrival, another blacksmith in the town was murdered. Kordgrimm was accused and, although he was cleared, a woman named Sélène Repse remained convinced of his guilt. She came to see him one evening in his forge and tried to take justice into her own hands, but her dagger was intercepted by a flaming poker. Kordgrimm is still a blacksmith and a dwarf, he didn't let himself be fooled so easily. During the brawl, he pressed Selene's face into the blazing fire of his forge.

He had no doubt of the repercussions his act would have. Selene was much loved here: he had to flee. He left Acolet that very night, and took advantage of the darkness to head for Redania. Wandering the roads without the comforting warmth of his forge, Kordgrimm turned to gambling to earn enough to satisfy his hunger. What began as a necessity eventually took over his mind, turning him into a compulsive gambler.

And so, to satisfy his addiction, he found himself in Novigrad. Gambling capital. The capital of crime, where his services would be required. A capital corrupted by the eternal fire, making dwarven blacksmiths of his calibre rare.

He needs money and customers. What's more, an elven blacksmith is also rumoured to have opened a shop in the same district as him. So Kordgrimm is determined to prove that he forges the best steel in town.
