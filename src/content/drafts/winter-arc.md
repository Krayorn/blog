## Situation overview

It's early october, it's been one week since I came back from vacations and instead of feeling pumped or energized, I feel a bit ..lost?

In the last months, I've been working a lot. On side projects such as the weekly algo arena, my first steps trying to earn some money through the internet with my paid app DonkeyCarrot, my http server in go, one chrome extension, practicing some algo exercices, learning more about ML, and I must forget some stuff. I've also been working on a side business, more serious than what I play around with on my own. Without forgetting my 9 to 5.

Putting all of this down, I realize that quite a lot of stuff. And to be honest, I'm proud of what I've done.

But I was expecting to come back from my trip, and start grinding again right away, however this week I had trouble deciding what to work on, and why I was even working on it.

Maybe I needed a bigger break, or I needed to not take a break at all. But I can't do the former, and it's too late for the latter, so, what the fuck am I doing ? 

By writing this post, I hope to find or more precisely, recall, what really matters to me. I'll define some targets for the next few months, or as I've seen it mentionned online lately, for my winter arc (epic musical drop - I really like this name).


## What really matters ?

I've only been talking about work and code in the first paragraph, but that's not at all the only things that are important to me.
I love board games, and I didn't get to play a lot of them in these last months. I'm also enjoying bouldering and running and need to keep time for those activities. I also want to keep reading books and finally, I'm picking up piano again and aim to practice a few minutes almost every day.

I know it sounds like a lot, but I waste so much time everyday, I think this is all very managable. And besides, what's the point of working hard if it's not to be able to do things I love more?

Now regarding my last and main hobby, or maybe I should say passion ? Programming and building things.
I love doing new stuff and learning things, but I didn't just do random things.
There was two important side quests:
- Make money
- Create an history of getting shit done

The good thing is that I can do pretty much anything and as long as I document it, it will help the second quest. The bad thing is that despite what I've been trying to do, I didn't try that much to make money..? 

It took weeks to launch DonkeyCarrot that was coded in maybe around 10 hours, and I've had more plans for the last two months and barely started them. I've also had other ideas of stuff to launch, most of them silly, a few intriguing, and one or two more serious, but I didn't start anything? It's like I don't even want to make money, despite the fact being that I truly do. I need to, I've got a mortgage to pay, I need to put money aside for security, I want to make sure my parents will be ok and I want the freedom to work on what I want.

## Goals

For the next few months, I want to:

- Play board games and role playing games
- Play piano
- Do sport
- Read

- Focus on the side projects that have a the potential to make money
- Try to tweet once a day (== have done something interesting once a day?)
