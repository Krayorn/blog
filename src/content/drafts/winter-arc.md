## Situation overview

It's early october, it's been one week since I came back from vacations and instead of feeling pumped or energized, I feel a bit ..lost?

In the last months, I've been working a lot. On side projects such as the weekly algo arena, my first steps trying to earn some money through the internet with my paid app DonkeyCarrot, my http server in go, one chrome extension, practicing some algo exercices, learning more about ML, and I must forget some stuff. I've also been working on a side business, more serious than what I play around with on my own. Without forgetting my 9 to 5.

Writing all this down makes me realize that it's quite a lot of stuff. And to be honest, I'm proud of what I've done.

I was expecting to come back from my trip, and start grinding again, but this week I had trouble deciding what to work on, and why I was working on it.

Maybe I needed a bigger break, or I needed to not take a break at all. But I can't do the former, and it's too late for the latter, so, what the fuck am I doing ? 

By writing this piece, I hope to find or more precisely, recall, what really matters to me. I'll then try to set some goals for the next few months, or as I've seen online lately, for my winter arc (I really like this name).


## What really matters ?

I've only been talking about work and code in the first paragraph, but that's not at all the only things that are important to me.
I love board games, and I didn't get to play a lot of them in these last months. I'm also enjoying bouldering and running and need to keep time for those activity. I like to read books and want to keep doing that. Finally, I'm picking up piano again and aim to practice a few minutes almost every day.

It can look like it's a lot of things to do, but I waste so much time everyday, I think this is all very managable. And besides, what's the point of working hard if it's not to be able to do things I love more?

Now on the side projects, I did all of them because I love learning new things. But I think there were also two important side quests:
- Make money
- Create an online presence by getting some stuff done

Those are the two real end games here, the good thing is that I can do pretty much anything and as long as I document it, it will help the second quest.

## Goals

For the next few months, I want to:

- Play board games and role playing games
- Play piano
- Do sport
- Read

- Focus on the side projects that have a the potential to make money
- Try to tweet once a day (== have done something interesting once a day?)
