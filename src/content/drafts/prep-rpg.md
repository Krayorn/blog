I've played the last two saturdays playing roleplaying games, and I have games scheduled for the next two. As the dungeon master for those games, that means I need to prep! ho shiiiiiiit

## My background

I'm still a beginner in the DungeonMaster role, I've played way more than I have DMed but recently I wanted to try some new systems, and that meant learning the rules and DMing for them! 

As a player I've mostly done:
- a lot of D&D
- a few very long Cops games
- a long standing Black Flag campaign

As a DM I did:
- An ongoing witcher campaign ~10 or so sessions in
- A Warhammer fantasy short adventure (2 sessions)
- Witcher One shots
- D&D one shots
- some murder mystery games without any rule system

Despite this somewhat "short" experience, I'm very happy with the games I've DMed and got some good notes about it from the players

## Whiteboarding

I start by finding what's the main idea for the session, usually it's something fun, epic or intriguing. 
Sometimes I don't really have to work to find it, because the previous session set it up perfectly.
But for the one shots, I really go a bit further, what do I want to make the players feels ? Is there a type of enemy that would be interesting ? What's typical from this universe that I could use.
