This post ("Welcome ot the future") is full of links and videos of crazy tech innovations. From self-driving cars and home made prothesis  to security robots and gamified drone warfare. The post claims we live in the cyberpunk future we read about in old-school sci-fi, and I'd say that's pretty accurate. 

Part of it is amazing, but most of it is unfortunately way too distopian.

Social medias algorithms are a plague. Companies make billions by capturing every single data points of every one they can get their trackers on. They fight to get our attention, no matter the cost, no matter the way.

This is not the future I expected.

When I was a kid, the future I had in mind was not one of LLMs that act as your number one hype-man while trying to get you to spend more time with them instead of seeing real persons. 

I thought it would be filled with screenless experiences, augmented reality, holograms and interconnected stuff (and flying cars and bikes obviously). And to be honest, we're so close to that! The progress on this front is amazing, but at the same time, I still have issues connecting my computer to a bluetooth speaker. I still cannot use a voice assistant to reliably handle some tasks on my phone.

And even if we manage to make all of it work, which we will in the near future, most of it will be unusuable. I'm getting spam calls everyday despite using blocker apps. My emails are flooded by people trying to sell me something, or companies trying to get me to try their products again. 
X is deranking posts with links to avoid people clicking out of the site, what will they do if I try to interact with it without seeing the sponsored posts?
