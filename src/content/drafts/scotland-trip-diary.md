I did a trip in Scotland with my partner this spring and while waiting for our flight back, we spotted a notebook with a nice tartan style. We thought it could be a fun idea to make a diary out of it, with pictures and some recap of what we did, where we went and to try and capture some of our feelings from the trip.

Then we realized it would be nice to share it to our friends and family
