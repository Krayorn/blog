So this post is my first rant. Let's go. 

Aaron Francis, who is amazing shared this quote in his newsletter

> you have to operate in the world as it exists and not as you wish it to exist.

I understand the sentiment, and I think this is valuable advice. But I also think it can lead to some pretty bad stuff. 

Twitter and Linkedin are always full of the same advices, one of them is:
> Distribution is king

The rest of the tweet or the quotes or all the replies are basically a mix of:
- Good marketing, bad product will beat bad marketing, good product 100% of the time
- Put more effort into marketing, less in the product

This is how the world works. And that's true, people can't enjoy a product they never heard about. But this sucks. Products aren't competing on innovation, beauty or usefulness. They start competing on attention, marketing, and copying to not get left behind.

It's not that I don't understand it, it's just I despise it. 

> You gotta do tiktok content, put in the work, and you will get installs, and subscriptions 

I hate seeing the ads, the clickbait content, the fake videos from influencers when I scroll online, 
the platforms are already so bad, I don't want to participate in making them worse ? 

> clickbait, lifestyle social media post

A&B testing the life out of a website,
everything looks the same, it's soulless, have some taste

> 

ai can do it for you super fast, don't spend time writing this / crafting it
