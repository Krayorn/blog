I'm a little late, but I thought a review of my board games plays from this year could be fun to do. I've worked on adding some pages to my app to get some fun data explorable through an interface !

So in 2023 I've played 79(and 2 in 2024 so far, no filters yet) games, that is 6,5 games a month, or one every 4,6 days... not bad, not bad.

I've also played with 27 different people, which is higher than I'd have thought ! 

Let's look at some of the games I played this year: 

## Monster Hunter World

This game by [SteamforgedGames](https://twitter.com/SteamforgedLtd) is one of my most played in 2023 with 8 games and 75% winrate. I received the game this year from a Kickstarter, and I plan to play many more games in 2024, with one campaign already started and another one planned with another group. So far the game feels fun, some of the harder monsters definitely brings a serious challenge and I can't wait to fight them in a campaign setting ! 
I also got 6 of the hunters painted, and plan to work on the monsters from for the current campaign ! 

## Arkham Horror

My most played game this year ! with multiples campaign and quite a few defeats with a 65% winrate ! I've bought some small-ish expansions already and will probably get a few more.

I really wish to chain a full campaign in a try-hard afternoon or evening as it sounds super exciting and fun. I've played as Wendy Adams, Stella Clark and Roland Banks. The red decks being my favorite so far, but I really wish to try “Skids” O'Toole, maybe in the next game.

That's enough for the screenshots, I definitely need more views to see games played on a calendar.
But let's not talk about some games I didn't play enough of last year, but wants to bring to the table more often this year ! 

## Some honorables mentions

Being Received only in December, I didn't have that much time to table Tales Of the Rift, but the two games I did were a blast, and I want to get many more games of it. 

Similarly, Senjutsu arrived late last year, but I still managed to play 3 solo games and 3 games with friends, and it was so fun ! Once the rules are understood I'm sure we can get way way faster playing, allowing us to do two or three fights in a single evening. I've played every character from the base game, with maybe a preference towards the warrior and student gameplay for now. 

I've only played Star Wars Shatterpoint twice, and that's a shame ! It's a great game, but the setup time, rules explanations and just playing are quite long, and I did not find someone to play it regularly with me yet.

There is plenty of other games I want to play a bit more this year, for example, Godtear, Assassin's creed brotherhood of Venice or The Witcher Old World. But I do not want to be overly optimistic, if I can get a decent number of games in the 3 mentionned earlier, I'd be stoked !

To accomplish this, I'm starting to think about organizing a bi-weekly game night, but I still have to figure out some of the logistic of it.
