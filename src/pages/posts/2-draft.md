Writing is scary for a multitude of reasons, some are rationals, but most are not.
Lately what scares me the most is the idea that the act of writing itself might become worthless. I don't think it's true, but I want to expand on that in this piece.

I'm not a very good writer, with my flaws and bad habits but also maybe with a certain style and vibe that should be kinda unique.
And i like that ! I try to improve it by writing more at work, on this blog and through some of my hobby by creating stories around my roleplaying games. My style is refining and evolving constantly, but what's the point ?

I could go on ChatGPT right now, write 4 terrible sentences that contains the gist of my feelings and it would write a better piece than i do. Hell, also give him other articles from this blog, my tweets and some of my writing from my job, and it would also match my style. 

So, why do I still try to write ?
To be honest, i'm not sure why I want to write, and sometimes I am afraid that i'm loosing my time. But i'll try to answer my own interrogations.

## Predicting the future

What is really making this idea haunting for me is that I have no idea how much advanced the LLM can become. Whatever issues it currently has could get fixed, patched, erased by another version, whereas my writing style evolve at a much slower pace. So what predictions can i make ? And more importantly, on what can i base them ? 

My instinct tells me that in a world where writing becomes automated, good writing will be even more valuable. We're already flooded by informations and content, and there now is one crazy way to make even more content, which can be of somewhat good quality.

We're already encountering stupid situations, where i'm reading a resume produced by GPT from my ARC browser of an article written by ChatGPT, i mean, really ? what's the point

I believe readers will still value being able to connect to a writer, following his thoughts in the way that they intended to. Content written by a human can be relatable

## The easy wins

One thing that i found true about writing is that it helps organize my thougts. We often hear that you don't understand something fully until you can teach it, and i think something similar could be said about writing. If you can't express it clearly, it's probably a bit too messy for you. Ben Kuhn wrote a bit more about it in [Writing to clarify thoughts](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing-clarify-thoughts/). 
I started this post with vague ideas, and they came to life in a deeper level of understanding as i wrote and rewrote them. I'm sorting them from a messy blob of data into readable sentences.
