Writing is scary and difficult for a multitude of reasons. Lately I've been thinking a lot about the idea that the act of writing might become irrelevant.
My gut tells me this scary thought is not true, but I want to expand on that in this piece.

My writing has flaws and bad habits, but it also carries my style and vibe that should be kinda unique.
And I like that ! I try to improve it by writing more at work, on this blog and through some of my hobbies. My style is refining and evolving constantly, but somewhat (especially when I'm having trouble putting down what I want) I'm asking myself: "what's the point ?!"

I could go on ChatGPT right now, write four terrible sentences containing the gist of my feelings and it would write a better piece than I ever could. Hell, also give him other articles from this blog, my tweets and some of my writing from my job, and it would also match my style. 

So, why do I still try to write myself ?
To be completely honest, I'm not sure. And sometimes I fear that I may be losing my time. But I'll try to answer my own interrogations.

## The easy win

One thing that i found true about writing is that it helps me organize my thougts. We often hear that you don't understand something fully until you can teach it, and I think something similar could be said about writing. If you can't express it clearly, it's probably a bit too messy for you. Ben Kuhn wrote a bit more about it in [Writing to clarify thoughts](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing-clarify-thoughts/).

I started this post with vague ideas, and they came to life in a deeper level of understanding as I wrote and rewrote them. I'm sorting them from a messy blob of data into readable (I hope) sentences. This is not a development that would have occured if I didn't write this piece myself, even if the generated post could have included some of the understandings I'll make, I wouldn't have learned them as a result of the process.

Ok, that was the simple one. Let's dig deeper.

## Predicting the future

I'm going to go astray for a bit, but to understand the place of written content in the future, I want to take a look at some possibilities. 

I have no idea how much more advanced LLMs will become(This is what makes this so daunting to me). Whatever issues they currently have will get fixed, patched, erased by another version, whereas my writing style evolve at a much slower pace (To be fair, if I could output content at a speed of 100s of token per second, maybe I would improve much faster). 

So what predictions can I try to make ? What will be the place of writing in a close future ?

### I - Companies/Product/SaaS blogs

Some blogs are already fully automated (by ([seobot](https://seobotai.com/), [drafthorse](https://www.drafthorseai.com/))). With AI writing titles, outlines, content produced on a daily/weekly basis with no human reviews needed. You can get thousands of articles written in a day. This flood the Web, but this content mostly serves one goal: [facilitate acquisition](https://twitter.com/jakezward/status/1728032634037567509) by appearing on more Search results. 
As long as Google Search works like it does now, it will keep happenning. 

**Prediction #1**: Search will drastically evolve to avoid this trend, with a revolution of SEO as we currently know it. All this content is often what I would consider low quality, not specially because it's badly written (as mentionned earlier, LLMs will evolve) but mostly because there is a limit to how much relevant stuff you could say about a topic. Most of theses articles will end up looking very similar to each other and will not add any value at all. (Google might react way too slowly tho, maybe a new contender will emerge ?).

**Prediction #2**: This kind of content (Why you should use our product, how to use our SaaS, Tips for X, Differences between Competitor Y and us...) will be replaced by a "chatbot like interface". By chatbot like, I mean a kind of dynamic page where the user query (maybe directly from Search) would be executed and generate something like a blog post, live, for your need. (Kinda sick.)

### II - Social Media/Interactions

Social Medias fought against bots and generated content for a long time. Even if content from LLM improve by a lot and are "similar" to the style of the poster, I don't think I'm taking a lot of risk by saying that they won't be welcome on most platform.

(**Mini Prediction #3**: There'll some platform that accepts and even encourage the use of LLM trained on your data to generate content, they will then let the LLMs produce content and interact, find the individuals or communities with the most chances of matching what you research and then introduce your real self to that. Matchmaking 2.0). 

I don't know how they can stop/limit this though. On Twitter, someone is selling a tool to [automatically generate answers](https://twitter.com/nilansaha/status/1730133017010794621) to other people. Someone else is using AI to post [automatically 10 tweets a day](https://twitter.com/codyschneiderxx/status/1720875445099413737). How long before half the interactions of the platforms is AIs talking to each other and some real users getting lost trying to make meaningful connections ?

AI Companions(romantic/friendship) are also becoming more popular, with [AI Girlfriend](https://twitter.com/enias/status/1729458928897912853) or [Meta characters](https://ai.meta.com/genai/). Theses are human-like connections that are always available, this gave them an edge over your real friends or partners. 

### III - Work

In work situations, a huge amount of interactions take place in writing. Be it project reporting, an RFC, a document or code review, a written standup... I assume a some people will always get a short version produced by a LLM instead of reading the full one. I also think a lot of theses will know be generated to appear more proffesionnal, knowledgable or successful. 

**Prediction #4**: Big companies, or heavily political ones will find themselves with a lot of individuals relying on generated content to navigate the spheres of influence. All (hopefully) companies will try to fight this. They will use the wrong methods: a ban on generated content (not verifiable), return to the office (won't be enough), more micro-management (poor workers) instead of relying on incentives and culture. Political companies will become even more political.

### IV - Other

We're already encountering stupid situations. I can read a recap produced by my browser(using GPT) of an article written by GPT. This is funny, and absurd. And I believe it will become a whole lot more absurd ! 

As mentionned earlier, changes of Search may improve some of this. For emails however, I think this was just the next step in the already heavy automated/spammy world. I guess we will all have to differenciate more between [trusted sources](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1729141146956574797) and unknown ones ?

**Mini Prediction #5**: Something will emerge to reverse the system of emails currently existing. Instead of being contacted by anyone knowing your email, you'll explicitely allow some emails to contact you (with limitations like "only 3 times per week" or "only monday"). It could also just be a democratisation of the public/secret key system where you would entrust some people, systems or apps with a key to contact you.

More generally in the digital world, it may also leads to:

## The place of written human content in this future

With this in mind, I do believe that some written content currently done by human will be replaced. 
But I didn't mention everything there, I did not talk about personal blogs, because I don't think they'll be as impacted. Sure, you'll get some automated ones, but the bonds created between a writer and a reader are a lot of what makes writing and reading blogs enjoyable. And you won't form a similar bond with content written by machine (or you might, until you learn it's not written by a human). And the experience deepens once you start exchanging with the author through other means, social media, email, video call, at conferences or around a cup of coffee.

In a world where writing becomes automated, good writing will be even more valuable.
We're already flooded by informations and content, and there is now a crazy way to make even more content, which can (& will) be of good quality.
What remains is the gains and the benefits from the process of writing, the bonds and the relationships created.
