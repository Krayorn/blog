### Film reviews


04-03-2024 - Freedom writers - Never heard of it but the title intrigued me. Ended up being a great experience, it's a heavy topic and it was well brought imo. 


03-03-2024 - Star wars 1 - Saw it when I was a kid, so first time really getting into it. Was really enjoyable ! Even though there was some questionnable decisions by characters and weird stuff ? Like why bring Anakin to a war zone at the end, the fact that the kid then proceed to land inside the enemy spaceship and blow it up all from one inside shot ! Maul fight was nice, even tho is death felt cheap, seemed like he had plenty of times to parry obi wan blow
